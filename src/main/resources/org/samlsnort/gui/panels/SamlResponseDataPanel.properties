destination=<html><b>Destination [Optional]</b><p width="200px">A URI reference indicating the address to which this request has been sent. This is useful to prevent malicious forwarding of requests to unintended recipients, a protection that is required by some protocol bindings. If it is present, the actual recipient MUST check that the URI reference identifies the location at which the message was received. If it does not, the request MUST be discarded. Some protocol bindings may require the use of this attribute (see [SAMLBind]).</p></html>
inResponseTo=<html><b>InResponseTo [Optional]</b><p width="200px">A reference to the identifier of the request to which the response corresponds, if any. If the response is not generated in response to a request, or if the ID attribute value of a request cannot be determined (for example, the request is malformed), then this attribute MUST NOT be present. Otherwise, it MUST be present and its value MUST match the value of the corresponding request's ID attribute.</p></html>
issueInstant=<html><b>IssueInstant [Required]</b><p width="200px">The time instant of issue of the response. The time value is encoded in UTC, as described in Section 1.3.3.</p></html>
issuer=<html><b>saml:Issuer [Optional]</b><p width="200px">Identifies the entity that generated the response message. (For more information on this element, see Section 2.2.5.)</p></html>
statusCodeValue=<html><b>StatusCode [Required]</b><p width="200px">A code representing the status of the activity carried out in response to the corresponding request.</p></html>

assertionIssuer=<html><b>Issuer [Required]</b><p width="200px">The SAML authority that is making the claim(s) in the assertion. The issuer SHOULD be unambiguous to the intended relying parties. This specification defines no particular relationship between the entity represented by this element and the signer of the assertion (if any). Any such requirements imposed by a relying party that consumes the assertion or by specific profiles are application-specific.</p></html>

canocializationMethodAlgorithm=<html><p width="200px">Signatures in SAML messages SHOULD NOT contain transforms other than the enveloped signature transform (with the identifier http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#enveloped-signature) or the exclusive canonicalization transforms (with the identifier http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n# or http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n#WithComments).</p></html>
signatureMethodAlgorithm=<html><p width="200px">SAML assertions and protocols MUST use enveloped signatures when signing assertions and protocol messages. SAML processors SHOULD support the use of RSA signing and verification for public key operations in accordance with the algorithm identified by http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1.</p></html>
certificateAlias=<html><p width="200px">Valid Alias from the key store</p></html>
subjectFormat=<html><b>Format [Optional]</b><p width="200px">A URI reference representing the classification of string-based identifier information. See Section 8.3 for the SAML-defined URI references that MAY be used as the value of the Format attribute and their associated descriptions and processing rules. Unless otherwise specified by an element based on this type, if no Format value is provided, then the value urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.0:nameid-format:unspecified (see Section 8.3.1) is in effect.</p></html>
subjectNotBefore=<html><b>NotBefore [Optional]</b><p width="200px">A time instant before which the subject cannot be confirmed. The time value is encoded in UTC, as described in Section 1.3.3.</p></html>
subjectNotOnOrAfter=<html><b>NotOnOrAfter [Optional]</b><p width="200px">A time instant at which the subject can no longer be confirmed. The time value is encoded in UTC, as described in Section 1.3.3.</p></html>
subjectRecipient=<html><b>Recipient [Optional]</b><p width="200px">A URI specifying the entity or location to which an attesting entity can present the assertion. For example, this attribute might indicate that the assertion must be delivered to a particular network endpoint in order to prevent an intermediary from redirecting it someplace else.</p></html>
subjectInResponseTo=<html><b>InResponseTo [Optional]</b><p width="200px">The ID of a SAML protocol message in response to which an attesting entity can present the assertion. For example, this attribute might be used to correlate the assertion to a SAML request that resulted in its presentation.</p></html>

conditionNotBefore=<html><b>NotBefore [Optional]</b><p width="200px">Specifies the earliest time instant at which the assertion is valid. The time value is encoded in UTC, as described in Section 1.3.3.</p></html>
conditionNotOnOrAfter=<html><b>NotOnOrAfter [Optional]</b><p width="200px">Specifies the time instant at which the assertion has expired. The time value is encoded in UTC, as described in Section 1.3.3.</p></html>
audience=<html><b>Audience</b><p width="200px">A URI reference that identifies an intended audience. The URI reference MAY identify a document that describes the terms and conditions of audience membership. It MAY also contain the unique identifier URI from a SAML name identifier that describes a system entity (see Section 8.3.6).</p></html>

authnInstant=<html><b>AuthnInstant [Required]</b><p width="200px">Specifies the time at which the authentication took place. The time value is encoded in UTC, as described in Section 1.3.3.</p></html>
authnContextClassRef=<html><b>AuthnContextClassRef [Optional]</b><p width="200px">A URI reference identifying an authentication context class that describes the authentication contextdeclaration that follows.</p></html>
subjectLocalityAddress=<html><b>Address [Optional]</b><p width="200px">The network address of the system from which the principal identified by the subject was authenticated. IPv4 addresses SHOULD be represented in dotted-decimal format (e.g., "1.2.3.4"). IPv6 addresses SHOULD be represented as defined by Section 2.2 of IETF RFC 3513 [RFC 3513] (e.g., "FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210").</p></html>

attributeName=<html><b>Name [Required]</b><p width="200px">The name of the attribute.
attributeNameFormat=<html><b>NameFormat [Optional]</b><p width="200px">A URI reference representing the classification of the attribute name for purposes of interpreting the name. See Section 8.2 for some URI references that MAY be used as the value of the NameFormat attribute and their associated descriptions and processing rules. If no NameFormat value is provided, the identifier urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:unspecified (see Section 8.2.1) is in effect.</p></html>
attributeFriendlyName=<html><b>FriendlyName [Optional]</b><p width="200px">A string that provides a more human-readable form of the attribute's name, which may be useful in cases in which the actual Name is complex or opaque, such as an OID or a UUID. This attribute's value MUST NOT be used as a basis for formally identifying SAML attributes.</p></html>
attributeValue=<html><b><AttributeValue> [Any Number]</b><p width="200px">Contains a value of the attribute.
